<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>My name is Brian Gilbreath, and I am Manager of Innovation and UX at AMC Networks in New York City!</p>

<p>Developing and being a tech lead is what I love most. I lead front end development
on all of AMC Networks websites, and have pioneered our internal web prototypes for all mobile and
living room apps (OTT). What makes this position so much fun is that it forces me to keep up-to-date with
latest and greatest technologies, and product management processes.</p>

<p>I work closely with designers, developers and product teams to ensure the stakeholder's visions are first and foremost,
doable, but also extendable and concise. I work closely with the back-end teams to make sure their API's and servers connect to the front-ends seamlessly. I also contribute to the PHP development on our back-end systems that are responsible for our API's. These are interesting challenges that keep me refreshed with OO fundamentals, and extend my learning in back-end concepts. This is crucial for understanding and scaling in the digital media landscape, as many of AMC's websites and devices are used by millions of people.</p>

<p>As media transitions to all types of platforms, I love pursuing the technical challenges that come
with new technologies. In addition to just development, I am also tech lead for the living room platform teams
and interestedin pursuing how media continues to transform the living room experience.</p>

<p>Check out some of the project's I've worked on over the last few years, including <a href="/technology/amc">amc.com</a>
 and <a href="/technology/amc">bbcamerica.com</a>, which were awarded Webby's in 2016 and 2017 for best television website.</p>
